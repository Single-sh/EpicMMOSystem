# Warning: 
- If you accept a friend request while the player who sent it is not logged in with the character, you will not be added to their friends list and they will need to resend the friend request.
- You cannot send friend requests to yourself or characters you have already added. If you need to send another friend request, remove the character from the list first.
- Friend requests that have been sent, but not accepted will be removed on logout. They must be accepted while both characters are online.

<details><summary>Creature level control</summary>

This mod assigns levels to all in-game monsters.
![https://i.imgur.com/IySsj3j.png](https://i.imgur.com/IySsj3j.png)
Monsters that are 1 level higher than the character (+ value from config) do not reward XP. Damage dealt to a higher level monster will be reduced by the difference in levels. E.g. (Character level 20/ Monster level 50 = 0.4. Damage dealt will be 0.4% of normal damage) Higher level monsters will have their names appear in red.

If you are significantly higher level than a monster, your XP award will be reduced. Monsters that are significantly lower level than you will have their names appear in cyan.

All of these formulas functions can be configured in the settings file.
A file listing all monsters and their levels is located in plugin/EpicMMOSystem/MonsterDB_"Version".

Please note:
When upgrading the mod to a newer version, new fields in the settings file will be created automatically. You will have to manually re-edit these values if you have changed them.
If you have no custom settings in the configuration file, you should delete the file so that a fresh one can be created by the new version.
